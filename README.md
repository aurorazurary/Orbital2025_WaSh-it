## User Stories
- As a *dormitory resident* who wants to do laundry, I want to be able to check machine availability before carrying my laundry, so that I don’t waste time and effort. 

- As a *NUS student and dormitory resident* who is incredibly busy and wants to avoid waiting, I want to book a laundry machine in advance so that I can plan my time efficiently. 

- As a *resident who has a booking*, I want to be able to receive a notification when my laundry slot is about to start or end so that I don’t forget my laundry. 

- As a *dormitory administrator*, I want to monitor machine usage for each individual(and also the general population) and detect potential misuse so that the laundry system remains fair for all residents.
